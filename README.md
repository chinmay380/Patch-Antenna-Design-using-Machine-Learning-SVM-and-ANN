# Patch-Antenna-Design-using-Machine-Learning-SVM-and-ANN
Hey Everyone!
I did this as my minor project for college, the basic idea was to predict the antenna output parameters with the help of antenna input parameters, Which otherwise would haven taken longer time for design and simulation using software.
Here i have taken a dataset with 100 observations these have four input parameters (Patch Length,Patch Width,Substrate Height,Epsilon) and four output parameters(Return Loss,Directivity,Gain,Efficency).
I have done it using two Machine Learning Alogrithms Support Vector Machine (Regression) and Artificial Neural Networks.
the looks to be working great with the given dataset.
i have also designed a Rectangular Patch antenna for 2.4 GHz using HFSS Software, which is used to validate the working of the ML model.
